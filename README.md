- 👋 Hi, I’m @NicholeStark
- 👀 I’m interested in all things technology. I like making electrical components and programming them, but I am most proficient in building the physical body.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program a microchip using WinAVR in Visual Studio 2019 to all the chip to take in information from an RFID chip.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything offered to me. I'm not picky.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at nichole.stark1003@gmail.com.
